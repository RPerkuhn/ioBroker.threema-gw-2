## threema-gw adapter for ioBroker

ioBroker Threema Gateway Adapter

Send threema messages using the threema gateway.

As prerequisite you need a gateway account at threema. Unfortunately this is not free of charge.
For prices have a look at https://gateway.threema.ch.

In this version of the Threema gateway adapter it can only support BASIC sending out of messages. No attachements and no returns are possible. For details you can visit https://gateway.threema.ch

If you decide to order a threema gateway account, you can choose a threema sender name (beginning with \*) and after successful registration you'll get an API secret.

This API secret and the eight digit sender name has to be entered into the configuration page.
Also the eight digit receipient Threema-ID has to be entered there.
If you need more receipients you can activate further instances and configure them with different receipients.

Once configured you can send out alert- or info messages including emoticons and linebreaks ("\n")

## Usage

To send a threema-message from ScriptEngine just write:

````javascript
// simple message using instance 0 of threema-gw
sendto('threema-gw.0','send','The battery in motion detector is low');

// message including emoticon, linebreak and special character using instance 0 of threema-gw
sendto('threema-gw.0','send','ðŸ˜Š\nThe temperature outside is above 25â„ƒ');

```

### DISCLAIMER

Please make sure that you consider copyrights and trademarks when you use names or logos of a company and add a disclaimer to your README.
You can check other adapters for examples or ask in the developer community. Using a name or logo of a company without permission may cause legal problems for you.

### Getting started

You are almost done, only a few steps left:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub with the name `ioBroker.threema-gw`

1. Push all files to the GitHub repo. The creator has already set up the local repository for you:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
1. Add a new secret under https://github.com/RPerkuhn/ioBroker.threema-gw/settings/secrets. It must be named `AUTO_MERGE_TOKEN` and contain a personal access token with push access to the repository, e.g. yours. You can create a new token under https://github.com/settings/tokens.

1. Head over to [main.js](main.js) and start programming!

### Best Practices

We've collected some [best practices](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.repositories#development-and-coding-best-practices) regarding ioBroker development and coding in general. If you're new to ioBroker or Node.js, you should
check them out. If you're already experienced, you should also take a look at them - you might learn something new :)

### Scripts in `package.json`

Several npm scripts are predefined for your convenience. You can run them using `npm run <scriptname>`
| Script name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `test:js` | Executes the tests you defined in `*.test.js` files. |
| `test:package` | Ensures your `package.json` and `io-package.json` are valid. |
| `test:integration` | Tests the adapter startup with an actual instance of ioBroker. |
| `test` | Performs a minimal test run on package files and your tests. |
| `check` | Performs a type-check on your code (without compiling anything). |
| `lint` | Runs `ESLint` to check your code for formatting errors and potential bugs. |
| `translate` | Translates texts in your adapter to all required languages, see [`@iobroker/adapter-dev`](https://github.com/ioBroker/adapter-dev#manage-translations) for more details. |
| `release` | Creates a new release, see [`@alcalzone/release-script`](https://github.com/AlCalzone/release-script#usage) for more details. |
